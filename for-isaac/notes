+= is the add AND assignment operator 

	repeated += character
	is the same as 
	repeated = character + repeated

go has really cool native bench marking tool *testing.B
	you can set it up in a for loop and it will 
	decide how many times to iterate then it will 
	dump out some metrics about the app runtime
