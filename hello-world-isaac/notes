I am using vim-go

helpful commands so far

:GoDoc with cursor over function queries manuals
:GoRun
:GoTest
:NERDTree

also you can go up in command history with arrows

this is the process for development:
Write a test asserting that if you pass in "French" you get "Bonjour, "
See it fail, check the error message is easy to read (this is what t.helper() is for)
Do the smallest reasonable change in the code

Make a broken test first, then get the test to pass, then make the code cleaner by removing 
hardcoded strings and things like that!
