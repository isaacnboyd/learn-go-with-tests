go has a test coverage tool:
go test -cover

which measures the percentage of functions that are covered by tests. Super cool!


Not all data types can be compared, you can't compare slices for example. 
use reflect.DeepEqual to compare any data type. I could have used this with Taints!!


You can also assign variables to a function for more limited scoping and readability. 
View checSums() var in the test.
